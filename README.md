eigenvalue problems.

### Important Features

- Reverse Communication Interface (RCI).
- Single and Double Precision Real Arithmetic Versions for Symmetric, Non-symmetric, Standard or Generalized Problems.
- Single and Double Precision Complex Arithmetic Versions for Standard or Generalized Problems.
- Routines for Banded Matrices - Standard or Generalized Problems.
- Routines for The Singular Value Decomposition.
- Example driver routines that may be used as templates to implement numerous
- Shift-Invert strategies for all problem types, data types and precision.
- `arpackmm`: utility to test arpack with matrix market files. Note: to run this utility, you need the eigen library (to handle RCI).

### ILP64 support

- Sequential arpack supports [ILP64](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/onemkl-linux-developer-guide/top/linking-your-application-with-onemkl/linking-in-detail/linking-with-interface-libraries/using-the-ilp64-interface-vs-lp64-interface.html), but, parallel arpack doesn't.
- reminder: you can NOT mix `ILP64` with `LP64`. If you compile `arpack-ng` with `ILP64` (resp. `LP64`) support, you MUST insure your BLAS/LAPACK is compliant with `ILP64` (resp. `LP64`).
- users: set `INTERFACE64` at configure time.

### F77/F90 developers

- all files which needs `ILP64` support must include `"arpackicb.h"`.
- when coding, use `i_int` (defined in `arpackicb.h`) instead of `c_int`. `i_int` stands for `iso_c_binding int`: it's `#defined` to `c_int` or `c_int64_t` according to the architecture.

### C/C++ developers

- all files which needs `ILP64` support must include `"arpackdef.h"`.
- when coding, use `a_int` (defined in `arpackdef.h`) instead of `int`. Here, `a_int` stands for "architecture int": it's `#defined` to `int` or `int64_t` according to the architecture.

example: to test arpack with sequential `ILP64` MKL assuming you use gnu compilers

```bash
$./bootstrap
export FFLAGS='-DMKL_ILP64 -I/usr/include/mkl'
export FCFLAGS='-DMKL_ILP64 -I/usr/include/mkl'
export LIBS='-Wl,--no-as-needed -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core -lpthread -lm -ldl'
export INTERFACE64=1
./configure --with-blas=mkl_gf_ilp64 --with-lapack=mkl_gf_ilp64
$ make all check
```

### Python support

`pyarpack`: python support based on `Boost.Python.Numpy` exposing C++ API.

Check out `./EXAMPLES/PYARPACK/README` for more details.

### About the project

This project started as a joint project between Debian, Octave and Scilab in order to provide a common and maintained version of arpack.

This is now a community project maintained by a few volunteers.

Indeed, no single release has been published by Rice university for the last few years and since many software (Octave, Scilab, R, Matlab...) forked it and implemented their own modifications, arpack-ng aims to tackle this by providing a common repository, maintained versions with a testsuite.

`arpack-ng` is replacing arpack almost everywhere.

### Directory structure

- You have successfully unbundled ARPACK-NG and are now in the ARPACK-NG directory that was created for you.

- The directory SRC contains the top level routines including
   the highest level **reverse communication interface** routines

  - `ssaupd`, `dsaupd`: symmetric single and double precision
  - `snaupd`, `dnaupd`: non-symmetric single and double precision
  - `cnaupd`, `znaupd`: complex non-symmetric single and double precision
  - The headers of these routines contain full documentation of calling sequence and usage.
  - Additional information is given in the `/DOCUMENTS` directory.

- The directory `PARPACK` contains the Parallel ARPACK routines.

- Example driver programs that illustrate all the computational modes, data types and precisions may be found in the EXAMPLES directory. Upon executing the `ls EXAMPLES` command you should see the following directories

  ```bash
  â”œâ”€â”€ BAND
  â”œâ”€â”€ COMPLEX
  â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile.am
  â”œâ”€â”€ MATRIX_MARKET
  â”œâ”€â”€ NONSYM
  â”œâ”€â”€ PYARPACK
  â”œâ”€â”€ README
  â”œâ”€â”€ SIMPLE
  â”œâ”€â”€ SVD
  â””â”€â”€ SYM
  ```

  - Example programs for banded, complex, nonsymmetric, symmetric, and singular value decomposition may be found in the directories BAND, COMPLEX, NONSYM, SYM, SVD respectively.
  - Look at the README file for further information.
  - To get started, get into the SIMPLE directory to see example programs that illustrate the use of ARPACK in the simplest modes of operation for the most commonly posed standard eigenvalue problems.

> Example programs for Parallel ARPACK may be found in the directory `PARPACK/EXAMPLES`. Look at the README file for further information.

### Install

The following instructions explain how to make the ARPACK library by using autotools and cmake.

First obtain the source code from github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng.git
cd ./arpack-ng
```

If you prefer the ssh, then use following to obtain the source code.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:opencollab/arpack-ng.git
cd ./arpack-ng
```

#### Using auto-tools

Now use the following commands to auto-configure, build and install the `arpack-ng`.

```bash
sh bootstrap
./configure
make
make check
make install
```

> Note, this will install the library at standard location (which is recommmended). You may need root privilage.

> Unlike ARPACK, ARPACK-NG is providing autotools and cmake based build system and iso_c_binding support (which enables to call fortran subroutines natively from C or C++).

#### Using CMake

You can install `ARPACK-NG` by using CMake. If you do not have Cmake, then please download the binary from `pip` using:

```bash
python3 -m pip install cmake
which cmake && cmake --version
```

After installing CMake you should use following lines of code in the terminal:

Note: Make sure you are in `arpack-ng` directory obtained from github.

```fortran
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -D EXAMPLES=ON -D MPI=ON -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
  make
  make install
```

> Do not miss the `..` in line 3, as it denotes the location of source files.

> The above script will builds everything including examples and parallel support (with MPI).

### Using ARPACK-NG in Cmake project

You can use arpack in your CMake builds by using `ARPACK::ARPACK` target. For example,

```cmake
  FIND_PACKAGE(arpack-ng)
  ADD_EXECUTABLE(main main.f)
  TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(main PUBLIC ARPACK::ARPACK)
  TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(main ARPACK::ARPACK)
```

To use PARPACK in your Cmake builds, use `PARPACK::PARPACK` target:

```cmake
  FIND_PACKAGE(arpack-ng)
  ADD_EXECUTABLE(main main.f)
  TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(main PUBLIC PARPACK::PARPACK)
  TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(main PARPACK::PARPACK)
```

### Extras

On mac OS, with GNU compilers, you may need to customize options:

```bash
LIBS="-framework Accelerate" FFLAGS="-ff2c -fno-second-underscore" FCFLAGS="-ff2c -fno-second-underscore" ./configure
```

To build with code coverage:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCOVERALLS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make all check test coveralls
```

To get `ISO_C_BINDING` support:

```bash
    ./configure --enable-icb
    cmake -D ICB=ON
```

- The install will now provide arpack.h/hpp, parpack.h/hpp and friends.
- Examples of use can be found in ./TESTS and ./PARPACK/TESTS/MPI.

### DOCUMENTS

Within DOCUMENTS directory there are three files for templates on how to invoke the computational modes of ARPACK.

- ex-sym.doc
- ex-nonsym.doc and
- ex-complex.doc

Also look in the README.MD file for explanations concerning the
other documents.

### Custom installation examples

```bash
  LIBSUFFIX="64" ./configure; make all install
```

```bash
  cmake -DLIBSUFFIX="64" ..; make all install
```

```bash
    INTERFACE64="1" ITF64SUFFIX="ILP64" ./configure; make all install
```

```bash
    cmake -DINTERFACE64=ON -DITF64SUFFIX="ILP64" ..; make all install
```

```bash
    LIBSUFFIX="64" INTERFACE64="1" ITF64SUFFIX="ILP64" ./configure; make all install
```

```bash
    cmake -DLIBSUFFIX="64" -DINTERFACE64=ON -DITF64SUFFIX="ILP64" ..; make all install
```

### Using with Intel-MKL

How to use arpack-ng with Intel MKL:

- Let autotools/cmake find MKL for you based on pkg-config files (setting `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`) or cmake options (`BLA_VENDOR=Intel`).
- Refers to the Intel Link Advisor: <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl-link-line-advisor.html>.
