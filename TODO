* add a version somewhere to allow configure to detect it
* add icb_parpack_c and icb_parpack_cpp tests in autotools test suite
  check out TODO in PARPACK/TESTS/MPI/Makefile.am and .travis.yml
  => uncomment "TODO lines" in PARPACK/TESTS/MPI/Makefile.am
  => run: ./bootstrap; ./configure --enable-mpi --enable-icb; make all check
  => problem is icb_parpack_c.c and icb_parpack_cpp.cpp do not link...
     autotools gurus who could fix this will maybe find their way to a solution
     in the HDF5 tarball (check m4/aclocal_fc.* and PAC_* macros)
  => if this could be fixed: do not forget to uncomment TODO in .travis.yml
